Contest entry for the Fall 2011 challenge on http://aichallenge.org

This file parses the game engine output and contains a game state class.

This module/class exposes to the main bot:
- A map of the world (intended to provide an object to perform spacial analysis
  like "object X is in range of object Y" and so on)
- A series of dictionaries containing the various world entities (these are
  mostly intended to perform lookups and iterations)
- Several utility functions to issue orders, perform proximity checks, diffuse
  the hormons, etc...

The MAP is a 3 dimensional numpy array, in which the first two axis are the
X, Y coordinates of the world, and the third dimension contains a stack of
layers, where 0 means "empty" and any other value means "something is here".
This structure was chosed to allow:
- different entities to be stacked (food can spawn on a dead ant, for example)
- nonzero tests
- easy multiplication of the scent
The layers in the map are:
- water
- onw hills
- enemy hills
- food
- own ants
- enemy ants
- own dead
- enemy dead
- unseen counter
- exploration hormon value
- food hormon value
- fighting hormon value
All layers can contain a value >=0, with 0 == no entity of that type there and
the other values being used as multipliers for the scent.
    Given that contest organisers assert the max size of a map is be 200x200,
and that the numpy array is float64, and has 12 layers, the overall size of the
map can reach a maximum of 64/8/1024 * 12 * 200 * 200 = 3.75 Mbytes.
